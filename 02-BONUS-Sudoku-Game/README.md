# Project 3: Sudoku Game  

## **Project Overview**  
For this project, you will create a **fully functional Sudoku game** that allows a user to play via the **command-line interface (CLI)**. The goal is to **validate user inputs**, enforce Sudoku rules, and provide a playable experience.  

## **Project Requirements**  
Your Sudoku game must include the following:  

### **Core Features**  
âœ” **Generate a 9x9 Sudoku board** with a mix of pre-filled and empty spaces.  
âœ” **Allow the user to input numbers** into empty spaces.  
âœ” **Validate user moves** (ensure the number follows Sudoku rules).  
âœ” **Display the board after each move**.  
âœ” **Detect when the puzzle is solved** and display a victory message.  

### **Technical Requirements**  
- Use **object-oriented design** (at least **one abstract class or interface**).  
- Implement **at least 5 unit tests**.  
- Use **Streams, Map, or Filter** where applicable.  
- Include **at least one third-party package** (excluding JUnit).  
- Optimize where possible using **Big O analysis**.  
- **Build using Maven or Gradle**.  

## **Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements)**  
ðŸ’¡ **File-based save/load system** (allow users to save progress).  
ðŸ’¡ **Hint system** (suggest a valid number for a given cell).  
ðŸ’¡ **Multiple difficulty levels** (easy, medium, hard).  
ðŸ’¡ **Timed gameplay** (track how long a player takes to solve the puzzle).  
ðŸ’¡ **Basic AI opponent** (optional Sudoku solver mode).  

## **Project Planning**  
1. **Validate your project approach with the instructor.**  
2. **Break down tasks** (board setup, input validation, move handling, etc.).  
3. **Use a tool like Trello** to track progress.  
4. **Aim for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first** before adding extra features.  

## **Timeline**  
- **Duration:** 2 weeks  
- **Project Presentations:** TBD  
- **Daily standups and lessons** may be included.  

Good luck, and enjoy building your Sudoku game! ðŸŽ®
